Your training data, visualised. Veloq brings maps, charts, and fitness tracking together in one fast, offline-ready app.

Maps
View your activities on interactive maps with 3D terrain, route heatmaps, and timeline filtering. Choose from light, dark, and satellite styles. Scrub through charts and watch your position update on the map in real-time.

Route tracking
Automatically detect repeated routes and sections in your activity history. Compare efforts over time to see your progress on favourite climbs and stretches.

Charts and analysis
Heart rate, power, pace, elevation, and cadence — all synchronised with the map. View zone distributions, TSS, intensity factor, and lap breakdowns.

Fitness
Follow your form with CTL/ATL/TSB tracking and visual zones. Monitor HRV, resting heart rate, sleep, and wellness. View power and pace curves by sport.

Offline-first
Sync once, access anywhere. Your data is cached locally so it's always available, even without internet.

Privacy
All data stays on your device. No analytics, no tracking, no servers. Open source under Apache 2.0.
