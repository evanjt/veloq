MAP-FIRST VISUALIZATION
View your activities on an interactive regional map with timeline filtering and route heatmaps. Switch between light, dark, and satellite map styles. Explore 3D terrain views with synchronized chart scrubbing that highlights your position on the map as you analyze your data.

RICH ACTIVITY ANALYSIS
Dive into multi-metric charts for heart rate, power, pace, elevation, and cadence. Scrub through your activity with real-time map highlighting. View zone distributions, training metrics (TSS, intensity factor, efficiency factor), and lap breakdowns. Toggle between combined overlay and expanded stacked chart views.

ROUTE INTELLIGENCE
Automatically detect repeated routes and track your performance over time. Compare efforts on the same course to see your progress. Identify frequently-traveled sections with detailed match analysis. The route matching algorithm uses GPS geometry analysis to find similar routes regardless of where you started or which direction you traveled.

FITNESS TRACKING
Monitor your CTL/ATL/TSB fitness model with form zone analysis. Track whether you're fresh, fatigued, or peaked for your next event. View your training load trends over weeks and months.

WELLNESS METRICS
Track HRV, resting heart rate, sleep quality, and other wellness metrics. See trends in your recovery and readiness data alongside your training.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
View power curves and pace curves by sport. Analyze your zone distributions to understand your training intensity. Track your FTP, critical pace, and other threshold metrics over time.

OFFLINE-FIRST
Aggressive caching ensures your data is always available. Sync your activities once and access them anywhere without an internet connection. Perfect for reviewing your rides while traveling or in areas with poor connectivity.

PRIVACY FOCUSED
All data stays on your device. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection. Your credentials are stored securely using platform encryption. The developer has no access to your data.

MULTI-SPORT SUPPORT
Full support for cycling, running, swimming, and 20+ activity types with sport-specific metrics and analysis.
